# FriendFinder

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. 
This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. 
The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
